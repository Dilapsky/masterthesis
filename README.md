# masterthesis
This repository shows how I did my master thesis in TUM.  
This repository mainly consist of 3 folders: Data_Example, Report_to_Supervisor and Script.  
In Data_Example folder, both pieces of raw data and intermediate images are shown. Since the raw data is from DIDI GAIA Initiative(https://outreach.didichuxing.com/research/opendata/) whose size is extremely large, so only a pieces of raw data are allowed to upload onto Github. The intermediate images are images that generated in the process of feature engineering which demonstrate the process of image processing.  
In Report_to_Supervisor, the irregular slides report to my supervisor in TUM is shown. You can see the process of the fine-tuning the topic.  
In Script folder, the computer program codes for modelling, data processing, analysis, and prediction, etc. are shown with either .py or .ipynb format.  
I also attached a copy of my master thesis in the latest version here, to let you refer to it and welcome to give any advices to Dilapsky_Lee@outlook.com.
